Repository Description:

This repository contains three projects completed as part of the "Programming Methods" course at the University of Wroc≈Çaw. 
The projects cover various aspects of programming and computational concepts, including relational databases, logic gate simulators, and parsers with evaluators.

Project Descriptions:

1. Relational Databases:
  This project focuses on the implementation and utilization of relational databases. It includes features such as data modeling, query execution, and database manipulation.

2. Logic Gate Simulator:
  The logic gate simulator project simulates the behavior of logical gates commonly used in digital circuits. It allows users to construct and simulate circuits using various logical components.

3. Parser and Evaluator:
  This project involves the development of a parser and evaluator for programming language constructs. It parses input expressions and evaluates them according to predefined rules and grammar.
